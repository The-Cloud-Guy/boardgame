# DevSecOps: CI/CD pipeline to deploy a Sping Boot Boardgame on a Kubernetes Cluster

#### CI/CD   `Jenkins`
#### Tools      `Maven, Aqua trivy, Sonarqube, Nexus Respository, Docker, Helm, Kubernetes`
#### Cloud Platform  : ` AWS `

- This application was not developed by me. It's available online for learning purposes. 
So I **Dockerized** the application, created a **Helm Chart**, CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins** and also the **Kubernetes cluster** where the application will be deployed.
